Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm Jacob Smith, a first-year Economics Ph.D. student at Middle Tennessee State University. I am currently researching the early American whiskey market. My political economy interests include free market, public choice, rent seeking, special interests, and collective action problems.

On this website, you'll find a glimpse into my academic journey, including details about my current research projects and working papers. One such project, "Distillers and Chemists: Strategic use of the Bottled-In-Bond Act of 1897 by both firms and regulators," delves into the intricate interplay between industry and regulation, shedding light on historical strategies that continue to shape modern economic landscapes.

### About Me

I am currently a graduate teaching assistant and first-year Ph.D. student in Economics at Middle Tennessee State University's Jones College of Business. I'm also proud to have been selected as a Summer 2024 Fellow with MTSU's esteemed Political Economy Research Institute (PERI), where I have had the privilege of collaborating with leading scholars to tackle pressing economic and policy issues.

My academic journey began at Hampden-Sydney College, where I graduated Magna Cum Laude in 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Economics and a second major in Philosophy. This multidisciplinary foundation has equipped me with a diverse toolkit and a holistic perspective that I bring to my research and teaching endeavors.
