With a strong background in applied microeconomics and public choice theory, my research focuses on historical political economy, public interest regulation, and economic freedom.

### About Me

I am currently a graduate teaching assistant and third-year Ph.D. student in Economics at Middle Tennessee State University's Jones College of Business. I'm also proud to have been selected as a Summer 2024 and 2025 Fellow with MTSU's Political Economy Research Institute (PERI), where I have had the privilege of collaborating with leading scholars to tackle pressing economic and policy issues.

My academic journey began at Hampden-Sydney College, where I graduated Magna Cum Laude in 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Economics and a second major in Philosophy. This multidisciplinary foundation has equipped me with a diverse toolkit and a holistic perspective that I bring to my teaching and research endeavors.
